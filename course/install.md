# Install

## Before this

Make shure that the version of the .Net framework you're using is at least 3.5.

## Into PowerShell

First, you probably want to use the last version of PowerShell (When writing 3.0). If you not shure of the version you're aving right now, Window 7 as the 2.0 by default and Window 8.x is shipped win PowerShell 3.0.

If you are not shure of the version you're using, please type this command : 

```
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

Most of the scripts availlable on this repository wont run under PowerShell 2.0 so be carefull.

If your computer does'nt benefit of the 3.0 version, you can upgrade it by downloading the latest package [on the microsoft website](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595). Multiple version will be availlable to you : 

- Windows6.1-KB2506143-x64.msu pour Win 7 64Bits
- Windows6.1-KB2506143-x86.msu pour Win 7 32Bits

The two others are for window server 64 and 32 bits.
