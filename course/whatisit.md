# What is it ?

Windows PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language built on the .NET Framework.  -- Wikipedia

As a Linux user, i'm rather devoided sitting in front of a Window cmd prompt, can't doing mutch with this. It's good to start a ping command but sadly that's about it. Not very powerfull and not doing mutch things.

PowerShell is an other Microsoft prompt built by Jeffrey Snover ans his team. But unlike cmd, PowerShell benefits of a better structure and many really good and usefull tools.

## What is so good about this ?

Well, I cannot tell mutch to you, it really depends on what you're doing and what you want to achive. That said, to me, it's about time, cause unix got those amaizing command systems with Bash and Shell that you can do anything with. It simply did not make sens that Window did not have this so far.

It's far better than what you can have with command, i'ts all working with object and it does include all of .Net so you can even developp with it! How cool is that ?

When I said you can do anything with it, well... I was lying. You can almost do anything, you'll still need to use your mouse for some actions  	â˜¹.

## It's familliar !

Because new is always better (well kind of... e.g. old Star Wars, not better than the old ones) it keeps all the functionnalities you used to have in cmd. For the unix/Linux guys, some basics commands can be used too.

## Give it a try !

You can start using it right now, simply stop using cmd and start using PowerShell, at first you'll see you wont loose anything and then you'll figure out all the benefits it does have.
